# ProduceApp

The goal of this project is to take data from downloaded CSV files and write that info to a database to reproduce the local produce databases of the USDA as they have not built their APIs yet. I would then like to integrate my code into MAUI.NET and develop a functional android app where a user could saved favorites to their profile in the database.

Built a rudimentary server and started writing the DAO to call the CSV file for the FarmersMarket table and read it into a list.

Eventually, sever will need to be remade with an related user table.
